# @rewl/kit

Heavily inspired by [cosmokit](https://github.com/shigma/cosmokit).

This toolkit does not try to replicate or replace `underscore`, `lodash`, `radash` or other toolkits.

# Why?

- I believe I have coded those utilities tens of hundreds of times.
- To use *(somewhat)* more modern (but *not necessary* to be efficient) syntax.
- To make TypeScript and ESLint happy.
